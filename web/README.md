# WatchSpringboard Web

This directory contains a simple web-based prototype that mimics the interactive Apple Watch-style springboard from the original iOS project.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The page uses JavaScript and CSS to render the grid of icons. You can drag the springboard around, zoom with the mouse wheel and click an icon to "launch" it.

The icons are taken from the native project under `WatchSpringboard/Icons`.
